## How to Use These Diagrams

### Option 1: Include as ASCII Diagrams
- Copy the ASCII diagrams directly into your report
- Works well for text-based reports
- Easy to include in markdown/Word documents

### Option 2: Convert to Visual Diagrams
1. Use diagramming tools:
   - **draw.io** (https://app.diagrams.net/)
   - **Lucidchart** (https://www.lucidchart.com/)
   - **Mermaid** (https://mermaid.live/)
   - **PlantUML** (http://www.plantuml.com/)

2. Convert ASCII to visual:
   - Copy the structure
   - Recreate in visual tool
   - Add colors and styling
   - Export as PNG/SVG

### Option 3: Use Mermaid Syntax
Some diagrams can be converted to Mermaid syntax for automatic rendering:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] --> B[Network Drive]
    B --> C[Chokidar Watcher]
    C --> D[Node.js Controller]
    D --> E[Sharp Processor]
    E --> F[WebSocket Server]
    F --> G[Browser]
```
